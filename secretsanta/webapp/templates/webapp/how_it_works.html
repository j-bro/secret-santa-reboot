                        The person who will manage the group first creates an account. From there, he/she can start a
                        group and add members to it using their email addresses. With everyone added to the group, the
                        manager creates an exchange, specifying the price cap and the date of the exchange. An email is
                        sent to all the members of the group with instructions on how to join the exchange.
